## Description Of the Project

This project featured a full-scale rebuild of the Rio Colorado Golf Course's website, starting completely from a blank screen on both the design and code. Nothing was sacred as we analyzed which pages and features should be consolidated or removed entirely. Taking the site from the 1990's into the modern era, it has been future-proofed with technologies such as responsive design, React, MongoDB, and GraphQL. It has features such as a full course page with hole selector tool, user login/logout authentication containing Admin-level privileges such as site price customization, and queries and mutations for full CRUD capabilities.
