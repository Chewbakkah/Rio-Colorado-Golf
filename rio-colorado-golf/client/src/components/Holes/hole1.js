        Your round begins with a risk/reward Par 5 that plays 528 yards from the
        back tees. Water runs along the entire left side of the hole and the
        driving range to the right of the tees is out of bounds. A tee shot hit
        along the left side will leave you a long iron into the green for your
        second shot, but be careful, a gentle slope along the left side will
        feed any errant shots into the water. A good play is to layup to the
        center of the fairway leaving you a wedge to a double tiered green.
